A Vogon Constructor Fleet is a group of yellow ships used by the Vogons to destroy planets. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy states that it is impossible to hitch a lift on a Vogon Constructor Fleet, however, Vogons employ Dentrassis as chefs on their ships. The Dentrassis hate Vogons, and frequently allow hitchhikers to come aboard. A Vogon Constructor Fleet was used to destroy Earth, and, led by the ship known as the Business End, was later used in an attempt by the Vogons to destroy the planet Nano. The particular fleet featured in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is captained by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz. Description 
The ships in the fleet are described as yellow, and are said to hang in the air "the way that bricks don't".
