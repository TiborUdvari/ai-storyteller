Majikthise is a  philosopher. He makes his appearance along with Vroomfondel as a representative of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and other Professional Thinking Persons in order to protest a demarcation dispute against Deep Thought, the computer which is being asked to determine the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, and to demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty. He, along with Vroomfondel, maintains that the search for ultimate truth is the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Books
