Veet Voojagig appeared in a Guide entry, which appeared in the novels and the radio series.

Veet Voojagig was interested to find out what had happened to all the pens he had lost over the years. He developed a theory that somewhere in the universe there was a planet full of biros where they could live the biro version of the good life, which they all slipped off to as soon as they could. 

He later claimed to have found this planet and worked for a while as a chauffeur for a family of cheap green retractables. 

He was promptly sent into tax exile, a fate reserved for those determined to make a fool of themselves in public.
