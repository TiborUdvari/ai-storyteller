Mr L Prosser was a council worker who tried to demolish, and eventually succeeded in levelling, Arthur Dent's house. 

Mr. Prosser was "only human" and was a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, although "the only vestiges left of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats". 

He died when the Earth was destroyed by the Vogons on a Thursday.Description
In the first novel, Mr. Prosser was described as "forty, fat, and shabby". He was a "nervous, worried man". One thing he was especially nervous about was the demolition of Arthur Dent's house. He wore a fur hat, which was somewhat reminiscent of Genghis Khan's own.

Mr. Prosser liked axes, unlike his rose-fancying wife. Mr Prosser's dream home was a home well away from all problems but right near a pub. Radio
