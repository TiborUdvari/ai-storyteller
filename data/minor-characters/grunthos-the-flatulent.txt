Grunthos the Flatulent was the poetmaster of the Azgoths of Kria, writers of the second worst poetry in the universe, coming between the third, the Vogons, and the first, Paul Neil Milne Johnstone.

The guide recites a tale of how, during one of his readings of his poem four of the audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off.

He was disappointed by the reception of his poem and so prepared to read his 12-book epic but was prevented from doing so when his major intestine leapt up his neck and throttled his brain in a desperate bid to save life and civilisation, killing him.Poems
