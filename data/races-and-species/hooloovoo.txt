The Hooloovoo resemble aÂ super-intelligent shade of the colour blue. One was seen in a prism for Zaphod Beeblebrox's address upon stealing the Heart of Gold. On certain special occasions, such as the aforementioned Presidential event, they refract into a free-standing prism.

Their home world is a collection of asteroids in one of the far flung arms of the galaxy. They are able to "read" material like books by occupying prisms, including a special edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The Hooloovoo demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the Universe by holding their breath until they turn a deep purple.Guide Note found in And Another Thing... Books
