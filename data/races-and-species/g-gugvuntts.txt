The G'Gugvuntts were a race of beings who had war declared on them by the Vl'Hurgs, as a result of Arthur Dent's voice reaching them through a freak wormhole. Although he said the apparently innocuous "I seem to be having this tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," in the Vl'Hurg tongue this was the worst insult imaginable. 

The two races fought for millions of years until they realised that the insult had originated on Earth, and combined forces to attack it. Unfortunately, due to a terrible miscalculation of scale, the entire fleet was eaten by a small dog.

A Vl'Hurg officer and his G'Gugvuntt girlfriend were seen at Milliways when Zaphod, Arthur, Trillian and Ford visited. Chapter 14, The Restaurant at the End of the UniverseReferences
