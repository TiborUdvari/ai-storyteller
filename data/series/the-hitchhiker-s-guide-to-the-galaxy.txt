The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science-fiction comedy series by Douglas Adams and usually refers to the first story in the series. It was originally conceived as a radio series on the BBC and later adapted into other media formats: including a book, a TV series, and even a film. The series is known for its commentary on life, death, probability and religion, as well as its quintessentially British themes.
 Plot 
Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation, however each of the various versions follow the same basic plot.

The story follows a human man named Arthur Dent as he narrowly escapes death when his home planet of Earth is blown up by a race of aliens called the Vogons. He is saved by his close friend Ford Prefect, who reveals himself to be an alien from Betelgeuse, and a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - the travel guide for hitch-hikers all over the Universe.

At the beginning of their journey, the pair encounter Ford's semi-cousin and President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and an astrophysicist and mathematician Trillian - the only other human to have survived the destruction of Earth along with Arthur. Though the story differs throughout each different form of media, these main characters, along with Marvin the manically depressed robot and their stolen starship the Heart of Gold, are included in every version.
