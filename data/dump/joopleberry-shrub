The joopleberry shrub was a pinky russet plant that grew on the home planet of the Shaltanacs: Broop Kidron Thirteen. It was used in a version of the saying: "the other man's grass is always greener". 

However, because of its colour, the Shaltanacs used the alternative phrase: "The other Shaltanac's joopleberry shrub is always a more mauvy shade of pinky russet". Broop Kidron Thirteen was known for being "somewhat eccentric botanically speaking." Radio
