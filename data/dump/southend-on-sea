Southend-on-Sea was a town and borough in southeastern Essex, England. It was destroyed along with the rest of the Earth in order to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect were familiar with Southend and likely visited it when living on Earth. While on board the starship Heart of Gold, while the Infinite Improbability Drive was in use, Arthur and Ford remarked that everything looked a lot like the sea front at Southend. However, the sea was steady as a rock while the buildings washed up and down, which was very odd. Radio
