Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on the planet Earth, whom Arthur Dent talked to when he wanted to find out what had happened to all the dolphins. He inadvertently let slip to Murray that he had caused Rob McKenna, hailed as the Rain God, to talk to someone about his remarkable history with the weather, and Murray immediately wrote an article on it, with Arthur subsequently getting roped into a photo shoot.

Murray appeared in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, and the Quandary Phase, in which he was played by Stephen Fry.
