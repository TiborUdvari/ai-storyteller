Share and Enjoy was the slogan of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints Division. This phrase had its own song, which was sung by a choir of robots during "special occasions."In the radio version, sung in Fit the Ninth. The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation tends to produce inherently faulty goods, which renders the statement ironic as few people would want to "Share and Enjoy" something defective. Among the design flaws is the choir of robots that perform this song: they sing a tritone out of tune with the accompaniment. The Guide relates that the words "Share and Enjoy" were displayed in illuminated letters three miles high near the Sirius Cybernetics Complaints Division until their weight caused them to collapse through the underground offices of many young executives. The upper half of the sign that now protrudes translates in the local tongue as "Go stick your head in a pig," and is lit up only for special celebrations.

A personal computer OS booting sound (Ã  la The Microsoft Sound) was set to the tune of "Share and Enjoy."From the episode Fit the Twentieth of the radio series Furthermore, there was a polyphonic ringtone version of the tune.From Fit the Twenty-Second of the radio series, the last episode in the adaption of the novel So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish The "Share and Enjoy" tune also was used as the backing for a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robot commercial (slogan: "Your plastic pal who's fun to be with!").From the TV seriesSong Lyrics
Share and Enjoy, 

Share and Enjoy, 

Journey through life

With a plastic boy

Or girl by your side,

Let your pal be your guide.

And when it breaks down,

Or starts to annoy,

Or grinds when it moves,

And gives you no joy,

Cause it's eaten your hat,

Or had sex with your cat,

Bled oil on your floor,

Or ripped off your door,

And it gets to the point

You can't stand anymore,

Bring it to us,

We won't give a fig.

We'll tell you

Go stick your head in a pig!
