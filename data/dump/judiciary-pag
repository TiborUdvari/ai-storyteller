Judiciary Pag, also known as Zipo Bibrok 5 * 108, was the judge who sentenced the people of Krikkit to be enclosed in a Slo-Time Envelope after they lost the war that killed two grillion people. 

He had earned the title LIVR (Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed). He was indeed extremely relaxed, even falling asleep while talking to the court, and having an affair with a member of the jury. Trivia 
Some fans believe it to be implied that Pag is related to Zaphod Beeblebrox. Both men share a carefree and cavalier attitude, and their names are also similar (Pag's real name being "Zipo Bibrok 5 * 108"). If this is true, Pag (who lived in the distant past) would be Zaphod's descendant, since the Beeblebrox family lives backwards in time.
