Santraginus V is the fifth planet from the Santraginus star. It is home to marble-sanded beaches containing "precious seashells", with seas full of "beautiful" sea-fish and sea-water, the last of which is part of the alcoholic drink theÂ Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. A performer from the band Disaster Area came here on a holiday, and stayed there forever, making friends with a rock.

In the video game, after hitching a ride with the Vogons the player (as Arthur Dent) wakes up to smell something pungent being waved under their nose. It is soon revealed that Ford Prefect has been waving a bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water under their nose, which implies it has some restorative qualities (when smelt). 

The game also reveals, if you try to drink the water, that even Santraginus Five seawater is illegal on most planets, and says 'you can imagine what kind of beach communities they have'From Part 2: In the Dark from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Video Game, 1984. Books
