Pizpot Gargravarr was a man whose body and mind had had a romantic relationship and was undergoing a period of legal trial separation, that would "likely end in divorce." His mind, who got the last name, was the Warden on Frogstar World B, and was roughly equivalent to the Frogstar prisoner relations officer in the radio series. His body got the first name and rather liked to go to parties. His mind served as Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.
