The Hrarf-Hrarf are a species which live backwards in time. They are said to find that getting the business of “sagging bottoms and death” out of the way at an early stage prepares them for an increasingly wonderful time after mid-life crisis celebrations. Their lives finish in a “really quite extraordinarily pleasant birth.” They were first mentioned in Life, the Universe and Everything.

The Hrarf-Hrarf are the only known race which enjoys hangovers, as for them it guarantees that a tremendously good evening will follow. 

When Arthur Dent found himself on prehistoric Earth, a planet on which he was born some two million years later, it was noted that any being other than the Hrarf-Hrarf would find that a terribly lonely position to be in. Book
