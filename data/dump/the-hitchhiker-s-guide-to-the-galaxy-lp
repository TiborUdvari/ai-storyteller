The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (appended with "Part One" for the subsequent Canadian release) is the adaption of the first four radio episodes into a double LP. It was originally released by Original Records in the United Kingdom in 1979, and in 1982 in the United States and Canada. Plot 
The script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes, although further cuts had to be made for reasons of timing. 

Despite this, other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when the original scripts from the radio series were eventually published can be heard in the LP version. The Simon & Schuster cassettes omit the Veet Voojagig narration, the cheerleader's speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven-and-one-half-million-year programme, and a few other lines from both sides of the second LP of the set.

Most of the original cast returned, except for Susan Sheridan, with Cindy Oswin taking her place.

Other casting changes in the first double LP included Stephen Moore taking on the additional role of the barman, and Valentine Dyall as the voice of Deep Thought. Adams's voice can be heard making the public address announcements on Magrathea. Sequel 
A sequel LP, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Part Two: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, was released in 1980.
