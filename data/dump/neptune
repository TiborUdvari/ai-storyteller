Neptune was the 8th planet in the Sol star system, the same one as Earth, Pluto and Rupert.Notes
It is unknown whether the rest of the Sol star system, including Neptune, was destroyed at the same time as the Earth to make space for the hyperspace bypass (although that was not the true reason). Therefore, it is unknown whether Neptune still exists.
