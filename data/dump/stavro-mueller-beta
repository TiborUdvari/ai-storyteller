Stavro Mueller Beta, previously thought to be a planet (Agrajag had referred to Arthur Dent's assassination on "Stavromula Beta"), is revealed to be a nightclub, the second of two such clubs owned by Stavro Mueller (the first club being Alpha in New York). It is in London.  

It is impossible for Arthur Dent to die before being here, as Agrajag went there before the Cathedral of Hate in his personal timeline, but Arthur Dent went there afterward. 

It was one of the many places where Agrajag believed that Arthur had killed him, as Random Dent shot at her father there, but Arthur ducked and the shot hit Agrajag, killing him.

It is the place that Arthur, Ford Prefect, Random and Trillian were in when the Earth was destroyed for the second time, in Mostly Harmless.
