The Shaltanacs are a sentient species native to planet Broop Kidron Thirteen. 

The species had their own variation of the Human phrase, "The other man's grass is always greener"; however, it went "The other Shaltanac's joopleberry shrub is always a more mauvy shade of pinky russet". The idiom fell out of use, forcing the Shaltanacs to be exceptionally happy and content with life, since Shaltanacs did not have word associated with the meaning of unhappiness. The Shaltanacs were thus the happiest species in all of the Galaxy, and often reviled as such. Radio
