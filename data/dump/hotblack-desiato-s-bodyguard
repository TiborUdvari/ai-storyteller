Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard was the man responsible for Desiato's body while its inhabitant was spending a year dead for tax reasons. He had a brief confrontation with a drunken Ford Prefect who was trying to talk to Desiato, before the bodyguard told Ford to "beat it". He encouraged Desiato to leave Milliways before the Universe ended, so that they could avoid the rush. Desiato talked to him using telekinesis as he was unable to speak while "dead". Description
The bodyguard was seven feet tall and not slightly built. His face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple. He had large, meaty hands with one of which he was able to lift up Ford off the ground. Apparently, conversation was a serious challenge for him.

When he encountered Ford at Milliways, he was wearing a white pinstriped suit with a black bowler hat. He had large brown sideburns and a moustache.From the fifth episode of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy television series. Novel
