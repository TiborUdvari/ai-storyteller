The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaint Department is always bustling with complaints. On top of the Complaints Department are the words of their slogan, "Share and Enjoy", in illuminated letters. One day, the words caved in, killing young, thriving employees. Only the top half of the signs are now visible. The new words, in the planet's native tongue, appear to say, "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer illuminated... except on special occasions. The Complaints Department is the only part of the company to still turn a profit and currently occupies all major land masses on three planets in the Sirius system.

The Sirius Cybernerics Corporation Complaints department has recently been rebranded as the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Customer Quality Prevention Division.
