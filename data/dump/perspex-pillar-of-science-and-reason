The Perspex Pillar of Science and Reason was one of the five parts of the Wikkit Gate. It was also the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, which was stolen in by the Krikkit War Robots in the middle of a trial. The confusion this caused meant that a witness, Prak, was given too much truth drug, and he then was forced to tell "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
