Saquo-Pilia Hensha was a planet on which the headquarters of the travel guide The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were moved to, after being bought out by Infinidim Enterprises. It was also home to an annual festival of the Assumption of St. Antwel, which involved a feast, dancing, and games. Ford Prefect once broke into the Guide offices on this planet, where he met the chief Vann Harl and a cheerful little security robot. His visit occurred at the same time as St. Antwelm's festival and Ford thought that it had a carnival atmosphere, which he had liked. Novels
