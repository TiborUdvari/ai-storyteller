Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes is the second installment in a trilogy written by Oolon Colluphid, the other two parts being Where God Went Wrong and Who is this God Person Anyway? Colluphid's trilogy of "philosophical blockbusters" is considered controversial but is less controversial than The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

It is possible that it is related to Colluphid's other book, Well, That About Wraps It Up For God, based on the theory that the existence of the Babel Fish proves the non-existence of God, as they are both related to the subject of God. Radio
