Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton was a character featured in the original radio series.  

Lady Fitzmelton was described as "one of the six thousand million people who hadn't glanced into the ionosphere on the Thursday that Arthur Dent's house was to be demolished to make way for a bypass, failing to notice any impending Vogon activity". 

She did not seem very popular, nor very adept at giving speeches. The residents of Cottington who were present for her speech responded with displeasure during it, especially when she referred to their local area as "cruddy". 

The Guide stated that those listening to the speech she was giving in front of Arthur's residence would have received great satisfaction to know that in four minutes later she would evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. However when the moment came, they would be too busy evaporating themselves to take any notice.

She stated that she was "honoured and privileged" to speak to the people of Cottington to mark the beginning of work on the "very splendid and worthwhile" new bypass that would be going through, as she decribed it, the "little country village of Cruddy Cottington." Physical description 
The only description of Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton comes from a nameless voice in the crowd who refers to her as a "crud-faced old bag."

The original radio scripts describe her as "a sort of Margaret Thatcher, or Penelope Keith type of character,". Radio
