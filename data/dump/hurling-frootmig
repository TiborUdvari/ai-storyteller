Hurling Frootmig was said to be the founder of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and was first mentioned in the third book in the Hitchhiker's series; Life, the Universe and Everything. Biography 
Frootmig established the Guide's fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, before he “went bust.” After this followed many years of heart-searching, which involved Frootmig consulting friends, sitting in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thinking about this and that, and fooling around with weights. This period of penury ended when he had a chance encounter with the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondoon, after which he refounded the Guide and “laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both.”

Following this change of heart, the Guide’s founder began to develop and explore the role of editorial lunch-breaks, which subsequently played a crucial part in the Guide’s history, since it resulted in visitors to the offices doing most of the actual work, instead of the editors. Book
