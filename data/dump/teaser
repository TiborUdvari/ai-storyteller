Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise around looking for planets that haven't made interstellar contact yet and buzz them, meaning that they find some isolated spot with very few people around, then land right by some poor unsuspecting soul whom no one's going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennas on their head and making beep beep noises. 
The concept of teasers was explained to Arthur Dent by Ford Prefect. Ford had arrived on planet Earth fifteen years prior to its demolition by hitching a lift with a teaser.
