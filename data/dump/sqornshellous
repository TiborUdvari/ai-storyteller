The Sqornshellous system is a six-star system twenty-seven light years from Earth. All of the planets mentioned are mainly inhabited by living cushions, mattresses and pillows. This system gives its name to the handbook of mattress etymology, Sqornshellous Swamptalk.Planets
The planets in the Sqornshellous system include:
Sqornshellous AlphaThe naming of the planets apparently is in order of discovery, not distance from its sun is a cold and unpleasant planet in which bristled acid-spitting mattresses are found.
Sqornshellous Beta is a desert, with square cushions which rub up your back.
Sqornshellous Gamma is hot and bumpy, with extremely thick atmosphere. It is "the worst place to crash-land" due to the thick atmosphere, which blocks radio and holographic waves, plus the 12' by 9' cushions are so forgetful that a conversation would go like this:
Who are you?
I'm (name)
Yeah. Who am I?
I don't know. You are a cushion.
Oh yeah. Who are you?
A person would die of frustration within an hour.
