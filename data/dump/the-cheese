The Cheese (type unspecified) is a minor god who is worshipped by the Tyromancers. According to Wowbagger, the Cheese isn't a particularly powerful god, his only powers being the ability to send out cheese dreams and divinity. At some point, he tried to murder Wowbagger at Wowbagger's own request. The Cheese attempted to kill Wowbagger with a cheese fondue, which failed but left him lactose intolerant.
