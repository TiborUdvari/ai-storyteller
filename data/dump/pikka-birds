Pikka Birds were a type of bird that lived on Lamuella and appeared in Mostly Harmless and the Quintessential Phase. They could be several colours, though not black. They took to laying eggs in mid-air to keep the population down.

A pikka bird was the only thing that could calm a charging Perfectly Normal Beast, a fact that was used by Old Thrashbarg and the Lamuellans to hunt the Beasts more easily. This fact was also what enabled Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent to ride a Perfectly Normal Beast off Lamuella and into The Domain of The King.Books
