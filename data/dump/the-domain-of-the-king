thumb|312x312px|Art of the Domain of the King produced for a Folio Society edition of Mostly Harmless by Douglas Adams.
The Domain of the King was a bar and grill restaurant located in a desert on an unspecified planet. 

This planet was apparently the true home of the Perfectly Normal Beasts that migrated across the Anhondo Plain of Lamuella twice yearly. For reasons unexplained, the portion of the Beasts' migratory path on this planet which would intersect with The Domain of the King was diverted to Lamuella.

Elvis Presley, who appeared to have not been abducted by aliens but to have gone to them himself, spent time here, hence the name being a reference to Presley's nickname of "The King (of Rock and Roll)". Books
