Lamuella is an idyllic planet on which Arthur Dent worked as a Sandwich Maker. It is home to humanoids called Lamuellans, migrating Perfectly Normal Beasts, and Pikka Birds. Arthur likes the system for the hours of the day (25, good for sleep-ins) and the days in the year (c. 300, no messing around). He also likes the number of suns and moons - one of each.

The Lamuellans worship the Almighty Bob. They are led by Old Thrashbarg and their blacksmith is Strinder.
