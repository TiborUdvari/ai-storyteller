Oglaroon is a large forest planet. The entire intelligent population of the planet lives in one small nut tree. They partake in the smaller version of life, and some speculate other life exists on other nut trees. These 'heretics' are thrown out of the tree. Most dwellers agree any other trees are merely an illusion brought on by eating too many Oglanuts. When one of the dwellers dies, they are strapped to one of the less accessible outer branches of the tree.
All beings are guilty of the same small-mindedness to some extent. This is why the Total Perspective Vortex is so devastating.
