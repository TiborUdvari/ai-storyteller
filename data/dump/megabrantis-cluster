The Megabrantis Cluster is a star group to which the Vogons migrated to after hyperspace was invented. There they formed the "immensely powerful backbone the Galactic Civil service."In the 2005 movie of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, however, the aforementioned Vogon migration had not happened. They left behind all other lifeforms from their home planet of Vogsphere but imported thousands of Scintillating Jewelled Scuttling Crabs to the cluster every year.
