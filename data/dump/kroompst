Kroompst is a word which is used by the Vogons describe someone who is a particularly cut-throat bureaucrat, such as when a Vogon forges ahead where others would have been "discouraged by Plural zones, hordes of Silastic Armorfiends or the tears of widows". It could also be said that to have Kroompst is to be "more Vogon-ish than the rest". 

It was once said that the term Kroompst could have been invented for Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz.

Whenever a senior Vogon uses this term, all others present must throw up their arms and echo the word in response, with much enthusiasm and spittle. Book
