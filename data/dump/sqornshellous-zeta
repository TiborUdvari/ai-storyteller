Sqornshellous Zeta is a swampy planet, found in the Sqornshellous system, best known for its mattresses. Its mattresses seem to be used all over the Universe, including in the Dentrassi quarters on board a ship that was part of a Vogon Constructor Fleet. One mattress, on the planet, talked to Marvin, who was stuck in the ground due to a defective leg. 

Sqornshellous Zeta is a very swampy planet, often covered in mist. The dew, at least in Marvin's opinion, falls "with a particularly sickening thud" in the mornings. There are grey swamp trees and tall reeds on the surface of the planet. Every morning at sunrise, the sun looks small, cold and slightly damp, before it sinks fourteen hours later with a distinct feeling of hopelessness.
