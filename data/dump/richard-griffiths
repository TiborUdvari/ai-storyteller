Richard Thomas Griffiths, OBE, was an English actor. He voiced Slartibartfast in the radio series, replacing the original voice actor Richard Vernon after his death in 1997. He also played Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in the 2005 film adaption of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Griffiths began his career working with the BBC Radio's Radio Drama Company and with stage performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He went on to appear in a great number of roles on TV and in film, both contemporary and period pieces. He is most known for Uncle Monty in Withnail and I (1987), as Magistrate Samuel Philipse in Sleepy Hollow (1999) and as Uncle Vernon Dursley in five of the films in the Harry Potter series. 

Griffiths was considered for the role of the Doctor in Doctor Who (which Douglas Adams also worked on), following Tom Baker's departure in 1981, but was unavailable. He was strongly considered once again to take on the role of the Eighth Doctor, however the series went on a long hiatus after 1989. Film
