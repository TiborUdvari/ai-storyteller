Scintillating Jewelled Scuttling Crabs are Crab-like creatures native to planet Vogsphere, the home planet of the Vogons. In the film, they are seen to have a bejewelled body, two eye stalks, and crab-like claws. History 
These crabs are one of the creatures which evolved on planet Vogsphere after the Vogons. These creatures are said to be much more aesthetically pleasing than said Vogons, as if made by the natural forces of the planet to make up for their previous blunder. The Vogons do not appreciate the beauty of these crabs and instead enjoy smashing the Scuttling Crabs with large iron mallets in order to cook them and eat their meat.

After discovering interstellar travel the Vogons left their homeworld of Vogsphere and migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the galaxy. However, every year they import twenty-seven thousand Scintillating Jewelled Scuttling Crabs and while away drunken nights by smashing these crabs with iron mallets. Radio
