thumb|SkaoiSkaoi was the Norse goddess of snowshoes. She was mentioned by Thor in the book And Another Thing... because Thor had dropped below her on the list of Most Loved Deities after the video that Zaphod Beeblebrox persuaded him to make. Thor was incredibly angry about this.

Although Thor says that she is just the god of snowshoes, she is in fact goddess of winter, mountains and skiing as well.
