Sass is a slang word which means to be familiar with someone, in any number of ways. Unrelated to the English word 'sass', it is more similar to the English word 'know', meaning both in the observational and biblical senses. To enquire if someone 'sasses' another can range from asking if they have heard of them, to whether they have met before, or even if they have slept together. Radio
