Sesefras Magna was a giant gas planet orbiting the star Zondostina in the Pleiades system. It was orbited by the small, blue moon of Epun, and the space near the planet was home to the space station Port Sesefron. Ford Prefect once took an Escape-O-Buggy from the sales ship he left in orbit around Epun to travel to Port Sesefron.

Sesefras Magna was home to gas dragons and the Cyphroles, a race of tiny invertebrate gastrozoa.From chapter 2 of And Another Thing.... Novels
