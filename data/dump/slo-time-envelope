The Slo-Time Envelope is a region in space where time is slowed downÂ infinitely. Within it, you would not even notice all of creation coming to a burning end. You will live out all of your infinite years in total ignorance of anything happening outside. Also, no one on the outside is able to observe anything going on inside.
The planet Krikkit was enclosed in a Slo-Time Envelope after the inhabitants waged war on the rest of the galaxy. They were sentenced to this punishment by Judiciary Pag.
