Tricia McMillan appears, she is played by Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the TV series.
David Dixon, who was Ford Prefect in the TV series, also has a cameo appearance.
From a Latin root, and following the earlier sequence, this would be the "quaternary phase," but a humorous and better known alternative term has been substituted, as with "quintessential." This seems reasonable, since relatively few native speakers are familiar with the term "quaternary," as demonstrated by the fact it is 'flagged' by the majority of spell-checking systems.
