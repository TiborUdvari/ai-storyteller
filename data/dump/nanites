Nanites were the Earthlings who lived on the Magreathean-made planet Nano. The Nanites were brought to Nano by Zaphod Beeblebrox and had an enemy tribe brought to the planet (also by Zaphod) called the Tyromancers. They were led by Hillman Hunter.

The Nanite's God was the class A god Thor, who mysteriously appeared to kill himself in a battle against the Vogon ship when it tried to wipe out the last of the Earthlings.

The Nanites went to battle with the Tyromancers in golf carts, where the trainers attacked an important figure. Books
