Stavro Mueller owned two bars - one in New York, called Alpha, and one in London called Beta. Stavro Mueller Beta appeared in the Quintessential Phase and Mostly Harmless. In this bar, Random Dent shot at her father, who ducked, and the shot hit Agrajag, who then claimed that Arthur had caused his death yet again. Shortly after this, the Vogons destroyed the Earth using the Grebulons, killing everyone in the bar, including Arthur, Random, Ford and Trillian.
