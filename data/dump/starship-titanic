The Starship Titanic was a majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol.

The starship Titanic was fitted with one of the early versions of the Infinite Improbability Drive. It had hardly left the space dock when it underwent a massive existence failure, even before it sent its first message, an SOS, due to the engineers not realising that the Infinite Improbability Drive had a quasi-reciprocal nature - in other words, anything that was infinitely improbable to happen on the ship, such as it crashing, was almost certain to happen immediately.

 Starship TitanicTrivia
Starting out as a footnote in Life, the Universe and Everything, the Starship Titanic featured in a full computer game where the ship in question was the setting.
The Doctor Who episode Voyage of the Damned also featured a starship called Titanic, although it was most likely inspired by the real RMS Titanic.
