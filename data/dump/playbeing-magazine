Playbeing is journal devoted in roughly equal parts to galactic politics, rock music, and gynaecology. One edition carried the results of an opinion poll in which the central offices of the The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy were voted the "third hippest place" in the whole of Ursa Minor. According to this same poll, the second hippest place in the whole of Ursa Minor was the entrance lobby to the same offices, and the hippest place in the whole galaxy was the left cranium of the fugitive galactic president Zaphod Beeblebrox. Beeblebrox himself once hitchhiked on an Arcturan Megafreighter that was carrying a larger number of copies of Playbeing than "the mind [could] comfortably conceive". A few hours after Beeblebrox hitched a ride aboard the Arcturan Megafreighter, it unloaded five-billion tons of Playbeing magazine on Ursa Minor Beta causing a slight, but largely irrelevant, shift in its orbital trajectory.  Radio
