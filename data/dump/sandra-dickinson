Sandra Dickinson is the American-British actress who portrayed Trillian in the 1981 television series of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and voiced an American version of Trillian (Tricia McMillan) who was from an alternate Earth in the radio series.

Dickinson is quoted as saying that she considered her recommendation for the role of Trillian "mad". She usually portrayed characters who fell into the trope of "dumb blondes", whereas Trillian in the book was described as dark and intelligent. However, when Douglas Adams saw Dickinson perform during a screen test, he liked it so much he asked her to use her American accent.

Dickinson was married to Peter Davison from 1978 until 1994, and they briefly appeared together in the Hitchhiker's TV series. Together, they had a daughter, Georgia Elizabeth Tennant (née Moffett), who appeared in another BBC sci-fi series Doctor Who, as her father had before her. Doctor Who was another BBC sci-fi television show which Douglas Adams worked on - as the script editor.
