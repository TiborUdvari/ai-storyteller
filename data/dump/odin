Odin is the leader of the Norse Gods. He is mentioned several times in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book  And Another Thing... but does not actually appear. 

He lives in Asgard, along with the other Norse Gods, including Thor, Loki and Skaoi. As well as being the leader of the gods, he is also the god of wisdom, healing and sorcery, and sacrificed one of his eyes to gain more knowledge. He was possibly part of a group of norse gods, along with his son Thor, who once dined at Milliways and his son was also present at The Longest Cocktail Party. Books
