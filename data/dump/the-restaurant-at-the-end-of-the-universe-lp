The script for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth, but includes a song by the backup band in the restaurant ("Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo"), and changes the Haggunenon sequence to one involving the band "Disaster Area". Cast 
Most of the original cast returned, except for Susan Sheridan, with Cindy Oswin taking her place.
