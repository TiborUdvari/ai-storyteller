The Power of Art was what the bird people of Brontitall claimed held up the cup part of their statue, Arthur Dent Throwing the Nutrimatic Cup. 

The statue was fifteen miles high, and the cup was hanging in midair at an altitude of roughly thirteen miles, with nothing holding it up except 'The Power of Art'.
