The Krikkit War Robots were small white robots that were not enclosed in the Slo-Time Envelope with the rest of Krikkit. They appeared in Life, the Universe and Everything, where they collected the pieces of the Wikkit Gate in order to release their masters. Arthur Dent first encountered them on Earth, where they stole the Ashes, also known as The Wooden Pillar of Nature and Spirituality.
