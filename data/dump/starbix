Starbix is a brand of breakfast cereal. 

In the television series it was mentioned that the simplistic glossary of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was copied off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, that cereal being Starbix. The editor, having to meet a publishing deadlineWhich Douglas Adams himself was no stranger to, as he was known for his failure to meet publishing deadlines, resulting in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novel ending abruptly due to Adams being asked to send in the latest version he had., hastily added some footnotes to his copied glossary, in order to avoid prosecution under the Galactic Copyright Laws.

A later editor of the Guide sent the book backwards in time in order to sue the company behind Starbix cereal for infringement of these Galactic Copyright Laws. The older version of Starbix is instead called 'Star Biks' and states that it is 'the serious cereal' and 'nasty but nourishing'. It is unknown if the flavour has improved since then.
