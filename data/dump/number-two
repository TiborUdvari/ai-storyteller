Number Two was one of the officers on the Golgafrinchan Ark "B". He was the only known officer on the ship to not seem quite relaxed, wanting to interrogate his prisoners, which the other officers did not really consider, and was the officer who pointed out that the Captain had been in the bath for over three years. 

He believed in authority, as he was convinced that Golgafrincham had been in imminent danger of being eaten by a mutant star-goat because his commanding officer (who remained on the planet) had told him this.
