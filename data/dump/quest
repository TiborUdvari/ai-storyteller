Quite Unwieldy Experimental Sublimation Torpedo, or QUEST, was an experimental anti-god missile used by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz to attack the god Thor.Â The Vogons bought the device from Zaphod Beeblebrox, who reveals that he installed a lawnmower engine on it in a scheme to defraud them. It was installed in the ship The Business End.
