Lord's Cricket Ground is a sporting arena at which Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect materialised on a Chesterfield sofa during the final Test match of the Ashes, which was won by England. Henry Blofeld and Fred Trueman, two real cricket commentators, were commentating on the match and in the radio series they played themselves. 

The match at which Arthur and Ford appeared occurred either one or two days before the destruction of the Earth by a Vogon Constructor Fleet, depending on the version.
