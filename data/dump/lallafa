Lallafa was a poet who wrote a collection of poems called The Songs of the Long Land. They were said to be so amazing that nobody could read them for long without having to go for a walk "around the block".

Years after writing this poetry, some correcting fluid manufacturers time travelled and made Lallafa rich. Because of this, he never wrote his poems when he was supposed to have done. This was easily solved by the correcting fluid manufacturers, who sent Lallafa to a forest one day with a later book of his poems to copy them out - making the occasional mistake and using the correcting fluid.

Some thought that this small change ruined the quality of the poems, but other people thought they were exactly the same as they always were and questioned if anything has technically changed. The first people set up the Campaign for Real Time in response.
