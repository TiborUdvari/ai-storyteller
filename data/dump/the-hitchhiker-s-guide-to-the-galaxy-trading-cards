The Hitchhiker's Guide the Galaxy trading cards are collectors cards which were released in 1994 by Cardz. They feature art from, and inspired by, the comic book series originally published in 1993, which itself was inspired by the original Hitchhiker's series by Douglas Adams. In total, there are 100 standard cards, including: 4 "Tekchrome" cards, 2 Hologram cards, 3 Prototypes (Promos), and an unknown amount of Autographed Cards, signed by Douglas Adams. There was only 1 Autographed Card per 4 cases of card packs - each card was signed on the back of the card, and all of the cards signed were different base cards from the set.  Details 
Each average pack includes 8 randomly packed cards. Each card is double-sided, with one side featuring an illustration, usually part of a panel from the original comics, and the opposite side featuring the trading card logo, an image of a character, and a relevant quote framed by an image of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The cards are numbered and cards number 01 - 52 feature illustrations in order of the sequences of events of Hitchhiker's.  Collection

 Alpha Centaurians Trivia 
 While the planet of the biros features in Douglas Adams' original series, several other planets featured in the "Planet catalogue" section of the card collection are not mentioned in the series and were seemingly made up exclusively for the cards. These planets do reference things that are featured in Hitchhiker's, however; Planet of Fish references fish, of which the Babel Fish is most notable, The Cow Planet references cows, of which the Ameglian Major Cow is most notable, and the Planet of Bad Taste may be a reference to Zaphod Beeblebrox being voted "Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe" seven consecutive times.
 Card #94 mentions Vogon Elementary School - the term "elementary school" being American English which wouldn't have featured in the original series. The idea of a Vogon schooling system does not feature in the original series.
