The Silver Tongued Devils are small mammals that are indigenous to the Hastromil system. They are relentlessly exploited due to the fact that every single part of their biology is useful: their tears can replace blood in transfusions, their hides can be used to make floats and boots, and their hinged tongues serve an unknown yet apparently useful purpose. Even their brainwaves can be harnessed to an aerial, used to boost signal reception
