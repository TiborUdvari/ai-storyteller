The universe is an unexplainable and complicated place.

It's mind-witheringly big and stupefyingly old. Add as a result of the cumulative effects of the more advanced forms of multidimensional travel, and it can be clearly seen to be having a rough time of it.

So it can be forgiven for being just a little unstable.

And an example of this instability that immediately springs to mind would be the cracks in the Fifth Dimension of Probability that are the Plural Zones.

And that's just what Plural Zones are: instabilities in space-time.

The effects of the Plural Zones on the beings and objects that inhabit and originate from them, for the most part, remain largely unnoticed, barring those which sometimes occur after the following three events:

The sudden destruction of said objects by, say, an overzealous hyperspace planning council,
Hyperspace travel itself, or
Outside meddling from beings that know about these sort of things

The results of the infliction of the first point can be likened to abducting a rubber duck from an infinite tube full of more rubber ducks. Take the one out of the picture, and another one will most likely just pop up from somewhere else in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash.

Hyperspace travel, for a being who originated in one of the Plural Zones, is a rather large risk. During hyperspace travel, such people have been known to skip dimensions entirely.
