Jynnan tonnyx is a drink invented by the Golgafrinchans, which the Captain of the "B" ark is fond of and offers to Ford and Arthur. 
It is noteworthy because roughly 85% of all planets have some drink with a similar sounding name, all of which were named before the planet made interstellar contact. The drinks themselves vary from plain lukewarm water to something that can kill a cow from a hundred paces. The only linking factor is the name.
Other versions of the name include gee'N'N-T'N-ix, chinanto/mnigs, tzjin-anthony-ks, jinond-o-nicks and gin-and-tonics.
