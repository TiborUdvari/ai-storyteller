Jikthroom Beta was a planet which contained a fallout shelter, inside which were drawings of the super-computer Deep Thought, the number forty-two, and other scribbles related to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe and Everything. It could be the planet where Deep Thought was built, although this is merely speculation.
