Old Thrashbarg is a Lamuellan priest. He worships Almighty Bob, and when asked about this god, he describes him as ineffable. According Old Thrashbarg's dictionary, this means "unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be known or spoken about.". He's the only one who has a dictionary in the tribe, but refuses to lend it to anyone, despite telling them to look words up if they don't know them. He lives on Lamuella.Books
