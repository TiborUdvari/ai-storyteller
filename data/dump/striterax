Home of the Silastic Armourfiends. The planet had plenty of underground bunkers since its surface was constantly wrecked by war. It was also where the supercomputer Hactar was commissioned and remained until he was shocked by the Silastic Armourfiends, after which he recombined to form a dark cloud around the planet Krikkit. Not much is known of the fate of the planet after its inhabitants discovered a new way to blow themselves up.
