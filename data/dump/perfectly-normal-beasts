The Perfectly Normal Beasts are animals which migrate on the idyllic planet of Lamuella twice a year before disappearing completely. The beasts are called "perfectly normal" by Old Thrashbarg so that no one will find it suspicious that they disappear into oblivion. They are hunted by the Lamuellans and put in the sandwiches made by Arthur Dent during his time as a sandwich maker. 

In order to escape Lamuella, Arthur and Ford Prefect ride on a Perfectly Normal Beast as they disappear and are transported to The Domain of The King. Books
