Peanuts or groundnuts are part of the legume or "bean" family. Ford Prefect buys four packets of peanuts from the pub, before using the Electronic Thumb to hitch a ride from the Vogons. 

Peanuts, because of the high salt and protein content, can be useful for regaining energy after travelling through Hyperspace, and it is because of this that Ford gave some peanuts to Arthur Dent after his first trip through Hyperspace.
