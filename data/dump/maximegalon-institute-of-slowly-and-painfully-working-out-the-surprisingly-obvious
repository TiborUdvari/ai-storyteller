The MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious, or MISPWOSO, is an institution mentioned in Life, the Universe, and Everything. It was famous for its Herring Sandwich experiments. It is part of the University of Maximegalon.Herring Sandwich experiments

The Herring Sandwich experiments were a series of highly famous experiments in which a robot was programmed to enjoy herring sandwiches, but was built so every time the robot tried to pick up the sandwich it would fall back on the floor. This lead to the scientists coming to the conclusion that herring sandwiches were the driving force behind every achievement in the history of the universe, and the publication of a paper on the topic that was deemed extremely stupid. The scientists then realized what they had discovered was the practical function of boredom. The scientists then began using things other than herring sandwiches, and began to discover the values of other emotions, including happiness.Trivia
Colin, the robot reprogrammed by Ford Prefect, was happy due to the placement of a chip containing information learned through the Herring Sandwich experiments.
