The Encyclopedia Galactica is a respectable, but on the whole insignificant guide and sells rather less than The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It is also more expensive and older than the Guide. It has also been criticised in some quarters for the lack of friendly advice on the cover, compared to the Guide. Radio
