Who is this God Person Anyway? is the third installment in a trilogy written by Oolon Colluphid. The other books in the trilogy are Where God Went Wrong and Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes. Colluphid's trilogy of "philosophical blockbusters" is considered controversial but is less controversial than The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

It is possible that it is related to Colluphid's other book, Well, That About Wraps It Up For God, based on the theory that the existence of the Babel Fish proves the non-existence of God, as they are both related to the subject of God. Radio
