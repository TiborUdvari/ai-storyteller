Betelgeuse (prn. bee-tull-joose) was star system XY8S Z GAMMA and the home system of both Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox. The life forms of Betelgeuse planets are carbon based.From the first episode of the TV series

The closest red supergiant which holds two, maybe three, planets. Betelgeuse's girls "will knock you off your feet", according to a chant recited by crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi-Werld III.

Betelgeuse V was where Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox grew up, and Zaphod was probably born there, although Ford was probably not. 

Betelgeuse VII is where Ford Prefect's father was born and where Ford lived when he was very young, and where a Hrung collapsed on, killing all the people who could speak in the dialect that Ford Prefect's name was spoken in except Ford and his father, who moved to Betelgeuse V. Therefore, since his own son could not pronounce his own name, Ford Prefect's dad died of shame, and the other kids nicknamed him Ix, meaning "boy who is not able to satisfactorily explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse VII".

New Betel is not known to be in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. This planet has a cafe in which Zaphod Beeblebrox and Hotblack Desiato practiced really bad songs for Disaster Area.

The Betelguese Herald is a news corporation from this system, and it labelled Disaster Area's music as "deafening rubbish."From the fifth episode of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy television series.
