Douglas Noel Adams (often referred to as "DNA" by fans) was an English author, comic radio dramatist, and musician. He was the creator of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, writing the original radio series, which were adapted for TV in 1981, and the first five novels.

He wrote for radio, television, and theater, and worked at various times as a hospital porter, barn builder, chicken-shed cleaner, bodyguard, and radio producer. He was also a script editor of the notorious Doctor Who series. Adams was known for his height â€” he was six foot five, about the same height as John Cleese, with whom he worked on-screen in Monty Python.

Toward the end of his life, he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment. Legacy 
Since his death at the tragically early age of 49 in 2001, he is still widely revered in science fiction and fantasy fandom circles.
