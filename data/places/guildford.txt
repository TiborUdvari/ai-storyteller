thumb|Map of GuildfordGuildford was the county town of Surrey, England. Ford Prefect, during his long time on Earth researching for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, claimed to be from this town originally, though he was actually from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.

The name looks a little like "Guide Ford" - Ford of course being a researcher for the Guide. It is unknown if this is a coincidence.
