thumb|A Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, the dominant lifeform, as seen in the 1981 TV seriesTraal is a planet in an unspecified part of the galaxy, most notably the homeworld of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. The Guide also describes Traal as having noxious fumes in the planet's atmosphere.

In most versions of Hitchhiker's, it is only mentioned as the home of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, but in the video game, the player visits the planet to pick up the Nutrimat/Computer Interface and meets the Bugblatter Beast.
